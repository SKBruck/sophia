                    <p>Katherine Valek recently presented her original research work at EMU’s Undergraduate Symposium. Here is her description of her research:</p>
                    <blockquote class="text-left">The nature of my research, entitled ‘Hearing Loss: The Silent Health Disparity’, is the analyzation of various aspects of hearing loss and its connection to healthcare settings, particularly nursing. To begin, hearing loss itself will be identified and defined, followed by acts to prevent hearing loss. Next, experiences of individuals with hearing loss in healthcare will be reviewed, leading the project to conclude with insightful, educated suggestions and recommendations for healthcare professionals in regards to caring for their patients experiencing hearing loss. However, the main population in focus of the project are Deaf and Hard of Hearing (HOH) individuals. Specifically, their unique experiences in healthcare communities will be evaluated. Interactions with healthcare workers in settings such as hospitals, emergency rooms, urgent cares, and physician offices will be presented as areas of interest among the Deaf/HOH. The goal of this project is to review published literature as well as generate new data in order to come to a conclusion as to whether or not hearing loss is indicative of a health disparity among Deaf/HOH patients. A health disparity is identified when a certain population of individuals experience poorer healthcare outcomes based on specific differences and disadvantages. The scope of the project in its entirety is based on members of the Deaf/HOH community, which can include American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters as well individuals that identify as Deaf or Hard of Hearing. When evaluating their lifestyle, specific interactions between the selected population and healthcare professionals will be examined and analyzed in order to come to connect or separate hearing loss and the prevalence of healthcare disparities.</blockquote>
